                    <p class="windowtext">After 15 years working in kitchens, making my way up from pot-washer to Head Chef, I wanted a new challenge.<br>
                        <br>I've been tinkering with code since I got a Commodore 64 for my 8th birthday and taught it to print ASH IS COOL using BASIC.<br>
                        <br>Lockdown saw me furloughed for a year and a half, and I stumbled across the PlayStation software Dreams, which is a PS4 visual coding application enabling users to build games for other PS4 users.<br>
                        <br>Ever the hobbyist, I entered some of their fortnightly game jams, and after placing 8th and 3rd out of tens of thousands of applicants, realised where my next challenge lay.<br>
                        <br>I signed up to the Manchester Codes (now called Command Shift) Software Developer Bootcamp and haven't looked back. I graduated in October 2022 and since then have been building, tinkering and learning every day.<br>
                        <br>Outside of coding, I love reading sci-fi books, taking photographs, playing survival games and snoozing with my 2 cats, Babs and Lenny.</p>
